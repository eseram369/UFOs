# UFOs

## Purpose
### The requisition from a client was to display a table collecting UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. The client wanted to filter by multiple criteria creating a dynamic website. The table created using JavaScript, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to modify the website's aesthetics.

## Results
### filters appear after being used
#### The result returns two matches by typing in the suggested placeholder elements as the filters. Make sure to organize everything in lower case letters and do not have spaces at the end of the text. Click off the input box or press enter to initiate the filter. To reset the filter criteria, click the UFO Sightings at the top left of the website.

## Summary
We have created a clean page and allows the user to filter through the various sitings in our data set using the search bars created. One big drawback about our search bar is validating the sitings that happened, which can be better to described in the data. How many people were at the siting would be a helpful element to validating the claims. Having as much data as possible for the website would make it as good as possible. My two recommendations for improving this website would 1. to have more data that has more information including how many people were at the site 2. add another filter to find the sitings by length and last but not least have a site that would constantly be updating our data adding new sitings to our page.
